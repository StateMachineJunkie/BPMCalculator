/// Implementation of a BPM calculator algorithm. The BPMCalculator class keeps a
/// running average or mean for the beets per minute (BPM) based on the period in
/// between input events. The number of entries used to calculat ehte average is
/// determined when the calculator is created.
///
/// Along with the running average for the period, the standard deviation is also
/// calculated in order to indicate how accurate and stable the BPM calculation is.
/// In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure that is used to quanitfy the
/// amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard
/// deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean of the set,
/// while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over
/// a wider range of values.
